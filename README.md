# Orbs
Tilebased jrpg/adventure game!

Exploration in a gridbased world, and enter strategic turn based combat with a twist!

# Current goals
Ideas that already are structured in my mind, and currently is of high priority:

  - Work on cameramodes. Eg. letting view lerp to player character when moving.

  - Implement a resource manager. (Class AssetManager made for this.)

  - Add charactersprites.

  - Fully implement adventuremode.

# Farstretched goals (Wishlist)
In no particular order:

  - Implement .tmx support instead of .csv for tile map handling.

  - Implement dynamic keybindings.

  - Implement config file read/write feature.

  - Implement an interesting map.

  - Implement saving/continue feature.

  - Implement the combat system.

  - Implement a story. (Just because..)

  - Implement multiplayer combat.
